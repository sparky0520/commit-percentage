1. Open a folder that is already initialized as a Git repository in VS Code or Cursor.
2. Make some code changes in one or more tracked files.

4. Look at the status bar (bottom left): the extension shows what percentage of the entire repo’s codebase your currently staged changes represent (for example, 🔵 3.42% of codebase).
